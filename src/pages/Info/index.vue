    <h1>Info</h1>

    <section>Welcome to my concept website! The purpose of this site is to integrate browser functionalities, allowing each user's personal webpage to act as an internet server. This enables you to share your information and interact with others. All data created is stored solely in the browser on your personal device (such as a PC or mobile device), eliminating the need to upload records or files to third-party servers. Data and files are only transmitted between you and your visitors to ensure your data privacy.</section>

    <h3>Data Storage and Privacy:</h3>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>All data and files created and shared through this site are stored exclusively in your personal device's browser.</li>
        <li>There is no need to upload records or files to any third-party servers.</li>
        <li>Data and files are only transmitted between you and your visitors, ensuring the privacy of your information.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>Use of Location Information:</h3>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>When you create an application within the site, only the coordinates you mark on the map will be used as information to help others find your application.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <h3>Usage Recommendations:</h3>

    <section>
      <ul>
        <li>It is recommended to use a personal computer to create and maintain applications on the site. Mobile device browsers may not maintain a stable connection when in the background, which could affect the application's functionality and interactivity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      I hope to provide a new way of web interaction through this platform and encourage all users to actively participate and innovate. If you encounter any problems during use or have further questions and suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:sinjiewang0316@gmail.com">me</a>.
