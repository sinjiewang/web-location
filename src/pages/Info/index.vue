    <h1>Info</h1>

    <section>Welcome to our experimental website! The purpose of this site is to explore and demonstrate the integration of browser technology, allowing each user's personal webpage to act as an independent web server. This means that you can share information, interact with others, and have complete control over your data.</section>

    <h3>Data Storage and Privacy:</h3>

    <section>We value your privacy and data security. All data created through this site is stored only on your personal device (such as a PC or mobile device) in your browser, and will not be uploaded or stored on any third-party servers.</section>

    <h3>Use of Location Information:</h3>

    <section>When you create an application within the site, we will use the coordinates you mark on the map so that other users can find your application.</section>

    <h3>Usage Recommendations:</h3>

    <section>It is recommended to use a personal computer to create and maintain applications on the site, as mobile devices may not maintain a stable connection when in background mode, which could affect the functionality and interactivity of the application.
    We hope to provide a new way of web interaction through this platform and encourage all users to actively participate and innovate. If you encounter any problems during use, or have further questions and suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</section>
